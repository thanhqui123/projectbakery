                There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of an SUV, and usage of the term varies
                between countries. Some definitions claim that an SUV must be built on a
                light-weight truck chassis; however, broader definitions consider any vehicle with
                off-road design features to be an SUV. A crossover SUV is usually defined as an SUV
                built with a unibody construction (as with passenger cars), however, in many cases,
                crossovers are simply mentioned as SUVs. In some countries — like the us — SUVs are
                classified as “light trucks”, leading to more lenient regulations compared to
                passenger cars.
